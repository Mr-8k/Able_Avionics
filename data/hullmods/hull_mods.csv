Advanced Avionics,diableavionics_avionics_reborn,,,,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.DiableAvionicsUpgrade_Reborn,"Diable Avionic designs feature custom avionics systems allowing for a much finer control of their ships. The reduction in parasite accelerations coupled with their proprietary Quantum Branch Prediction Computer allows those ships to optimize many of their systems the more time they spend in contact with the enemy.

Upon deployement the ship suffers a %s reduction of its weapons accuracy. But after each computation cycle of %s, the ship gains a significant boost to weapon accuracy, engine performance and shield speed. %s are necessary to achieve maximum performance with %s better engine acceleration, %s better target leading accuracy and %s better shield turn and unfold speed. When analysis is complete, the ship gains an additional bonus in the form of %s increased weapon damage.",,graphics/da/hullmods/diableavionics_avionics.png
